# ReverseShift
Switching between coordinate systems

## How does it work?

This HTML page allows reversing the offset in PRC Maps, and works both online and offline.

It works as follows: (1) Choose the coordinate system of origin, (2) paste the coordinates in the coordinates field, or in the latitude and longitude fields underneath if copied separately and click `Split` or `Transform` as required, resulting in (3) transformed coordinates that can be copied or opened in a corresponding mapping application right away. It's also possible to go the other way around, or convert from and to GCJ-02.
