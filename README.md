# ReverseShift
Switching between coordinate systems

## How does it work?

This HTML page allows reversing the offset in PRC Maps, and works both online and offline.

Open the page and select the coordinate system that you want to transform. Paste coordinates in the coordinates field or latitude and longitude, depending on what you have. The Split button splits the coordinates into latitude and longitude, and the Transform button transformes and pops new coordinates in the fields of the two other systems. Now you will be able to copy the transformed coordinates or open the location in the corresponding maps right away.
